Important: If required, ALWAYS update REQUIREMENTS.md BEFORE committing any changes.

After completing any code changes, file modifications, or feature implementations, always create a git commit with a
descriptive commit message that clearly explains what was changed or added. Use conventional commit format when
possible (e.g., "feat: add folder selection dialog", "fix: resolve EXIF parsing error", "docs: update README with setup
instructions").

When committing, ensure to include all necessary files and directories that have been modified or added.
