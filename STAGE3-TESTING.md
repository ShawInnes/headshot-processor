# Stage 3 Implementation - Testing Guide

## What's Been Implemented

### ✅ Folder Selection & File Discovery
- Native folder selection dialog
- Recursive JPEG file scanning (.jpg, .jpeg, case-insensitive)
- File validation and error handling
- Progress indicators and loading states

### ✅ EXIF Data Extraction & Display
- Comprehensive EXIF metadata parsing using `exifr` library
- Employee name detection from multiple metadata fields
- Handles missing/corrupted EXIF data gracefully
- Raw metadata display for debugging

### ✅ Photo Management Interface
- Clean, responsive table view of all photos
- Employee grouping and statistics
- Photo detail modal with image preview
- Status indicators (EXIF Read, Error, No EXIF)

## How to Test

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Select a Folder**
   - Click "Select Folder" button
   - Choose a directory containing JPEG photos
   - The app will automatically scan for .jpg/.jpeg files

3. **View Results**
   - See summary statistics (employees found, photos with/without metadata)
   - Browse the photo table with file details
   - Click "View" on any photo to see detailed metadata

4. **Check Employee Detection**
   - Photos with employee names in EXIF will show in green
   - Photos without employee data show as "Unknown" in orange
   - Employee badges show unique names with photo counts

## EXIF Fields Checked for Employee Names

The app searches these metadata fields in order:
- **Standard EXIF**: Artist, Copyright, ImageDescription, UserComment
- **Extended**: XPSubject, XPComment, XPAuthor, XPKeywords
- **IPTC**: Keywords, Subject, PersonInImage, RegionPersonDisplayName
- **XMP**: creator, subject, PersonInImage, RegionPersonDisplayName
- **Custom**: EmployeeName, Subject Name, Person, Name

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ With Employee Metadata
- Green user icon next to employee name
- Employee appears in summary statistics
- Grouped in employee badges with photo count

### ✅ Without Employee Metadata  
- Orange warning icon showing "Unknown"
- Counted in "Photos without Employee Data"
- Still displays other EXIF data (camera, date, etc.)

### ✅ Error Handling
- Red "Error" badge for corrupted files
- Detailed error messages in photo detail view
- Continues processing other files on individual failures

## UI Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Progress bars during file processing
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages
- **Modal Dialogs**: Detailed photo information
- **File Previews**: Image thumbnails in detail view
- **Sorting**: Organized file table with status indicators

## Next Steps (Stage 4+)

After testing this implementation, the next phases would include:
- File renaming based on metadata
- Employee-specific photo export
- API integration for email lookup
- Email functionality for photo delivery

## Troubleshooting

**No Photos Found**: Ensure folder contains .jpg or .jpeg files  
**EXIF Errors**: Check if photos have valid EXIF metadata  
**Preview Issues**: Some image formats may not display in preview  
**Performance**: Large folders (100+ photos) may take time to process
