# Headshot photo processing tool

This tool is to help process full of headshot's that have been taken.

## Features

1. allow the user to select a folder containing the photos
2. once the folder has been selected innumerate all of the JPEG files in that folder and add them to a list to display
   to the user
3. Include the mediator from the EXIF data within the JPEG files
4. Add a feature to rename all of the files based on the meta data within each file
5. There will be a field within the matter data containing the employee name. You need to select all photos pertaining
   to that particular employee and export them as employee_00 one employee_002 etc.
6. The files have been renamed. There needs to be a feature that will look up an API end point based on the employee
   name and obtain the email address
7. Once the email address has been obtained for that employee we need to email them their headshot photos.
